# pizzeria-web

<h1>Web Pizza</h1>
This project was developed during my learning process on JS course by B7Web.
The simulation involves a cart for purchase pizzas, which the user chooses some pizzas and a cart is created giving the final price. On this, only the frontend is approached, so there isn't a database and functionality when you finish. 

<h3>What I used?</h2>
On this project I used only HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
